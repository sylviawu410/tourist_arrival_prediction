Note(s):,,,,,
Seasonally adjusted series may be revised as more data become available.,,,,,
Four series of Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) are compiled to reflect the impact of consumer price changes on households in different expenditure ranges.,,,,,
"The CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) are compiled based on the expenditure patterns of households in the relatively low, medium and relatively high expenditure ranges. By aggregating the expenditure patterns of all households covered by the above three indices, a Composite CPI is also compiled to reflect the impact of consumer price changes on the household sector as a whole. The year-on-year rate of change in this index is generally taken to reflect overall consumer price inflation.",,,,,
"The CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) respectively cover some 50%, 30% and 10% of households in Hong Kong. The average monthly household expenditures (in HK$) of these groups during the base period (i.e. October 2019 - September 2020) were $6,500 - $27,999, $28,000 - $48,499 and $48,500 - $91,999 respectively. Taking into account the impact of price changes since the base period, the monthly household expenditure ranges of the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) adjusted to the price level of 2023 are broadly equivalent to $6,800 - $29,200, $29,200 - $50,400 and $50,400 - $95,900 respectively, and that of the Composite CPI is broadly equivalent to $6,800 - $95,900.",,,,,
"In calculating the average monthly rates of change during the latest 3 months in the seasonally adjusted CPIs, the new 2019/20-based CPIs are used as from the reference month of January 2020 onwards.",,,,,
"With seasonal variations removed from the original series, the seasonally adjusted CPIs enable a more meaningful comparison of figures in consecutive months. Since the month-to-month changes in the seasonally adjusted series still tend to fluctuate due to other irregular factors, the trend of the CPIs may be more clearly discerned by looking at the average monthly rates of change in the seasonally adjusted indices during the latest 3 months.",,,,,
